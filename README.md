Fault Analysis and Selection of Circuit Breaker Ratings in a Power System 

ABSTRACT
Power systems and transmission lines are growing day by day and getting complex structure. 
In this case, the possibility of failure increases. Lightning strikes, trees falling to transmission lines, animal entering in transformers, line breaks due to extreme load cause faults in power systems. The main aim of our project is detecting and locating the varying types of failures and short circuit currents, analysis them to select accurate circuit breaker in respect to the input data values of circuit such as input voltages, reactances, admittances etc. which would be taken by user via an interface (MATLAB GUI) for saving human lives, environmental safety and preventing economic investment and time losses caused by possible explosions or damages in the systems in real case scenarios.

Description of The Problem
Power systems are meant to be continuously functioning systems to sustain human life and therefore they need be protected against abnormal conditions such as short circuit faults and overloads. In case of a fault, circuit breakers must immediately cut off the current, which is very likely to be extremely high. In a power system, the selection of circuit breaker ratings must be done in accordance with the possible faults in order to protect the system against any damage and to ensure stability.  To assess the maximum ratings of the circuit breakers, a detailed fault analysis of the power system needs to be done.

Aim of the Project
The aim of this project is to review the issue of fault analysis in order to select appropriate ratings for the circuit breakers and to contribute to the issue.

Project Output 
The first output of this project would be a review of the subject using many sources, books and articles lay down what has been done. The second output would be to conduct possible calculations using software like C or MATLAB and learn the information and calculation method about the topic of project. The third output would be a case study, real or hypothetical. The forth output would be the proposal of a possible improvement. The made long - term project outputs are listed below;
. Being able to transfer circuit data and bus admittance of systems to MATLAB.
. Getting knowledge to analysis system faults in MATLAB.
. Being able to create MATLAB GUI (Interface).

ÖZET
Güç sistemleri ve iletim hatları her geçen gün büyüyor ve karmaşık bir yapıya kavuşuyor.
Bu durumda, başarısızlık olasılığı artar. Yıldırım çarpmaları, iletim hatlarına düşen ağaçlar, transformatörlere giren hayvan, aşırı yük nedeniyle oluşan hat kopmaları, güç sistemlerinde arızalara neden olur. Projemizin temel amacı, çeşitli tiplerdeki arızaları ve kısa devre akımlarını tespit etmek, giriş gerilimi gibi değerlere göre doğru devre kesiciyi seçmek için analiz etmektir. İnsan yaşamı, çevre güvenliği ve gerçek durum senaryolarında sistemlerde meydana gelebilecek olası patlama veya hasarların neden olduğu sermaye ve zaman kayıplarının önlenmesi için hata analizi ile doğru kesiciyi kullanıcıya önermenin büyük katkısı olacaktır.
